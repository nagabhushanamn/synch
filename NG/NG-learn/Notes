Now angular doing 2-way databinding ?

 angular life-cycle
 ------------------
 
   compilation-phase
   
   on every DOM element which are binded with directives/expression,
   will register 'watch expression' ( listeners ) to read/write ViewModel
   
   we can also register 'custom watch expressions'
   
   
   all 'watch expression' will get executed by 'digest-loop'
